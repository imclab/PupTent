PupTent

A set of useful components and systems built on top of Cinder and entityx.

PupTent is meant for use in the development of small games with big hearts.
Don't be afraid to create a new entity system for each level.
Also don't be afraid to have each level become the next by modifying the system.

Provides:
Fast batch renderer for 2d geometry
Locus component for flexible 2d spatial transformations
Sprite animation, loading from disk
Script system (c++ lambdas supported for now)

Todo:
Physics component and system wrapper around suBox2d
Line/Path expansion system, writing to RenderMesh2d
Lua scripting with script system

Requires:
Cinder 0.8.5
entityx (necessary bits included in src/)

Conventions:
typedef std::shared_ptr<T> TRef;
typedef std::unique_ptr<T> UTRef;
