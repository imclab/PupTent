PupTent

A set of useful components and systems built on top of Cinder and entityx.

PupTent is meant for use in the development of small games with big hearts.
Don't be afraid to create a new entity system for each level.
Also don't be afraid to have each level become the next by modifying the system.

Provides:
Locus component for flexible 2d spatial transformations
- position, rotation, scale, and registration point
Fast batch renderer for 2d geometry
- every mesh is rendered in one pass
- that means one texture, so keep in mind your sprites
Sprite animation, loading from disk
Script system
- executes arbitrary c++ functions
Physics system
- wraps suBox2d
- incomplete

Todo:
Line/Path expansion system, writing to RenderMesh2d
Lua scripting with script system

Requires:
Cinder 0.8.5
entityx (necessary bits included in src/)

Conventions:
typedef std::shared_ptr<T> TRef;
typedef std::unique_ptr<T> TUniqueRef;
